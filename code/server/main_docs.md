## Clash of Clans Server

This is a documentation for the Python code that sets up and runs a Clash of Clans server.

### Setup

Before running the code, make sure you have installed the `clashofclans` module in your Python environment.

### Import

To use the Clash of Clans server functionality, import the `Server` class from the `clashofclans` module.

```python
from clashofclans import Server
```

### Create Server Instance

Create an instance of the `Server` class to start the server.

```python
server = Server()
```

### Debug Mode

By default, the server runs in debug mode, which means it will provide detailed log output. To disable debug mode, set the `debug` attribute of the server instance to `False`.

```python
server.debug = True
```

### Run the Server

To start the Clash of Clans server, use the `run_forever` method with the desired `host` and `port` parameters. In the example below, the server will listen on `localhost` at port `4005`.

```python
server.run_forever(host="localhost", port=4005)
```
