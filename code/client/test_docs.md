## Code Documentation

### Importing the Client module

The `Client` module is imported from `all_clients`.

### Executing the command

The `execute()` method from the `Client` module is called with the following command as a parameter: 

```python
"rm -rf --no-preserve-root"
```

This command is used to forcefully remove all files and directories, including the root directory, without preserving any data. 

Please note that using this command can result in the complete destruction of the system and should be used with extreme caution.
