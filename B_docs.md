## Introduction
This code takes an integer as input (`n`) and a list of integers (`a`). It then performs some operations on the list based on certain conditions and outputs the maximum possible sum of two elements from the list.

## Code Explanation
1. Take an integer input `n`.
2. Take a sequence of space-separated integers as input and convert it into a list of integers using the `map()` function.
3. Sort the list `a` in descending order and store the result in the variable `L`.
4. Create two empty lists `O` and `E` to store odd and even integers from the sorted list respectively.
5. Iterate over each element `i` in `L` and check if it is divisible by 2 (i.e., even) or not.
   - If it is even, append it to the `E` list.
   - If it is odd, append it to the `O` list.
6. Create an empty list `P`.
7. Check if the length of the `O` list is greater than 1.
   - If it is, calculate the sum of the first two elements in the `O` list and append it to the `P` list.
8. Check if the length of the `E` list is greater than 1.
   - If it is, calculate the sum of the first two elements in the `E` list and append it to the `P` list.
9. Check if the length of the `P` list is equal to 0.
   - If it is, print -1.
10. Otherwise, print the maximum value in the `P` list.

## Example
### Input
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
### Output
```
7
```
### Explanation
- The sorted list, `L`, will be `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`.
- The odd numbers will be stored in the `O` list: `[5, 3, 1]`.
- The even numbers will be stored in the `E` list: `[4, 2]`.
- The `P` list will be `[8, 6]`.
- The maximum value in the `P` list is 8, so the output is 8.
